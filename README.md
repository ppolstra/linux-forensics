Linux forensics scripts as initially found in Linux Forensics by Dr. Philip Polstra

Please note these are Python 2 scripts.  Many will work fine with Python 3, but use at your own risk.  Also, if you are using the mount-image set of Python files I recommend you
grab the ones from the windows-forensics repository as they are Python 3 scripts and also implement a change that allows multiple partitions from an image to be mounted with
newer Linux kernels.

If you are looking for images to play with have a look at these links:
